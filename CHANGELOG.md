## Release Notes

### v2.0.0 Highlights

This major release introduces a modern, interactive TUI that transforms the user experience while maintaining full backward compatibility with the original command-line interface. The TUI provides guided workflows, real-time monitoring, and intelligent error handling that makes firmware generation more accessible and reliable.

Key improvements include:
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Intuitive interface guides users through the entire process
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live monitoring of build progress and system resources
- **Error Prevention**: Validation and checks prevent common configuration mistakes
- **Professional Packaging**: Easy installation via pip with proper dependency management

### Backward Compatibility

All existing command-line workflows continue to work unchanged. The TUI is an optional enhancement that requires additional dependencies, ensuring lightweight installations remain possible.

### Future Roadmap

- Web-based interface for remote build management
- Enhanced device compatibility and detection
- Advanced firmware customization options
- Integration with additional FPGA toolchains
- Cloud-based build services
